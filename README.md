# Benthic occurrences, habitat maps, and species traits

The aim of this project is to link occurrences of benthic invertebrates from (Eur)OBIS to EMODnet Seabed Habitats, using species traits (in particular substrate preference, larval development mode) from the BIOTIC database to refine this process.
